## helm-s3-publisher

Helm S3 Publisher is a project to help with the process of publishing new releases for charts.

### Synopsis


The Helm S3 Publisher project makes it easy to publish new releases to the AWS S3 Bucket.

Ideal for automating pipelines and follows these steps:
	1. Check the minimum requirements to start the process;
	2. The Git LS Tree feature is built into the CLI and helps you automatically check which charts have changed and will be updated.
	3. Validates whether the changed chart already has a published version. 
	   It is possible to force and override the version that exists in the repository. 
	   We do not recommend using this functionality in production, only in necessary cases.
	4. Then, package the chart.
	5. Finally, publish the chart to the indicated AWS S3 Bucket using the helm s3 plugin.

$ helm s3-publisher REPO [CHART PATHS] [flags]


- **REPO** => (Required)
	Repository for searching and publishing the new version of the chart.

- **CHART PATHS** => (Optional and Default: . ) 
	List of charts directories separated by commas.
	If the Git LS Tree feature is enabled, the CLI will attempt to identify all changed chart directories indicated in the PATHS parameter.
	Example: "dir-chart-1,dir-chart-2"
